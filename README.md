# FLoRaPHY
FLoRaPHY is a simulation framework of the LoRa physical layer for the [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) software. It tries to simulate the radio behaviour of LoRa transceivers following the structure of [INET framework](https://inet.omnetpp.org/) version 3.

It was an essential tool to develop the MSc thesis "[Leveraging Efficient Multihop Communication With LoRa Mesh Technology](http://castor.det.uvigo.es:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/476/TFM%20Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20L%C3%B3pez%20Escobar.pdf?sequence=3)" and more information can be found in this document.

A PingPong example is provided to help in future projects.

It was designed getting inspired by the [FLoRa framework](https://github.com/mariuszslabicki/flora) from University of Aalto ([flora.aalto.fi](http://flora.aalto.fi/)).
